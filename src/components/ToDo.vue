TODO: 
Work on Hero section:  Follow this guide to increase image / hero image quality ( - Use TinyPNG to reduce the file size without sacrificing quality - Use appropriate file format(JPEG for photographs
and PNG for graphics or illustrations) -Use lazy loading  to load the hero image only when the user scrolls to the section containing the image - Use a content delivery 
network (CDN): A CDN can distribute the load of delivering the image across multiple servers, improving the speed at which it loads.- Use caching to store the
image in the user's browser so it doesn't have to be reloaded every time the user visits the page.



- Router (colors..) and sections, linking
- Responsiveness
- The scrolling should work properly, when a page is visited, it should take you to the top, unless the link is for a section in that page then it should go to
appropriate section
- Complete readme.md
- Loading for Organizers
