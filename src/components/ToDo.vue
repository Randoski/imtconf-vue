TODO: 
1. Work around hero image issue for desktop (and maybe mobile)
2. Change color of Loading text in Loading.vue to purple and then white when loading
3. Follow this guide to increase image / hero image quality ( - Use TinyPNG to reduce the file size without sacrificing quality - Use appropriate file format(JPEG for photographs
and PNG for graphics or illustrations) -Use lazy loading  to load the hero image only when the user scrolls to the section containing the image - Use a content delivery 
network (CDN): A CDN can distribute the load of delivering the image across multiple servers, improving the speed at which it loads.- Use caching to store the
image in the user's browser so it doesn't have to be reloaded every time the user visits the page.
4. Nav links should change color on click or scroll
5. Add more breakpoints to make more responsive
6. Make hamburger change on click
7.
